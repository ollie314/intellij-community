This inspection reports classes, methods or fields in the specified inspection scope that
are not used or not reachable from entry points. It also reports parameters that are not used by their methods and all method
implementations/overriders and local variables that are declared but not used.<br> <br>
<!-- tooltip end -->
Use visibility settings below to configure what members should be reported, e.g. configuring report private methods only means
that public methods of private inner class would be reported though protected methods of top level class would be ignored.
<br><br>
Use check boxes in the inspection options below, to specify what should be automatically assumed entry points. You will
also have a possibility to add entry points manually when inspection results are ready. You may also configure annotations to mark members as entry points as well
as code patterns.
