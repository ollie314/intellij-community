Inspection detects the situation where a Java 9 module requires another Java 9 module but doesn't actually use any exported package from it.
<p>
  The fix deletes the 'requires' statement for such redundant dependency.
  If the deleted dependency re-exported modules that are actually used, the fix adds 'requires' statements for these modules.
